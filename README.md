## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nebiyou27/telecom-analysis-project.git
   cd telecom-analysis-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Use the following command to install required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Add environment variables in the `.env` file (e.g., database credentials).

4. **Run the Workflow**:
   - Execute Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder for detailed analysis.
   - Alternatively, use Python scripts in the `src/` folder for automated processing.

5. **Run with Docker**:
   - Build and run the Docker container:
     ```bash
     docker build -t telecom-dashboard .
     docker run -p 5000:5000 telecom-dashboard
     ```

## **Analysis Highlights**

- **Customer Overview**: Profiling user demographics and subscription patterns.
- **User Engagement**: Analyzing session durations, clicks, and total sessions.
- **User Experience**: Evaluating satisfaction scores and churn rates.
- **Key Findings**: Detailed insights derived from exploratory and statistical analyses.

## **Recommendations**
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are provided:
1. **Growth Potential**: [Insert your conclusion, e.g., "High growth potential due to increasing user engagement."]
2. **Acquisition Decision**: [Insert your recommendation, e.g., "Proceed with acquisition due to positive indicators."]

---

## **Limitations**
1. **Data Quality**: Missing or incomplete data may affect the accuracy of insights.
2. **Time Constraints**: Limited time for in-depth analysis of all variables.
3. **External Factors**: Lack of information on market trends and competitors.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Refine the model by incorporating additional data sources.
2. Implement predictive analytics to forecast user behavior.
3. Deploy the analysis as a dashboard for real-time updates.
